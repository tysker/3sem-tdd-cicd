## Kata 1 – FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is one of the most famous coding exercises for beginners. It is a simple exercise but an excellent one to start
learning the TDD flow with.

Requirements

1. Write a “fizzBuzz” method that accepts a number as input and returns it as a String.

Notes:

* start with the minimal failing solution
* keep the three rules in mind and always write just sufficient enough code
* do not forget to refactor your code after each passing test
* write your assertions relating to the exact requirements

2. For multiples of three return “Fizz” instead of the number

3. For the multiples of five return “Buzz”

4. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”.
