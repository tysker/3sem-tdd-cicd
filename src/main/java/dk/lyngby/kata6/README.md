## Kata 6: Banking kata

Note: This is an advanced example where the solution requires knowledge of using a mocking framework. The possible solution can also have an elaborated design. Solve it only if you feel comfortable with mocking frameworks and designing your code.

Create a simple bank application with features of depositing, withdrawing, and printing account statements.

**Constraints**

1. Start with a class with the following structure

```JAVA
public class Account {
    public void deposit(int amount);
    public void withdraw(int amount);
    public void printStatement();
}
```

2. You are not allowed to add any other public methods in this class

3. Use Strings and Integers for dates and amounts (keep it simple)

4. Donâ€™t worry about the spacing in the statement printed in the console

**Requirements**

1. Deposit into Account

2. Withdraw from an Account

3. Print the Account statement to the console

```
DATE       | AMOUNT  | BALANCE
10/04/2014 | 500.00  | 1400.00
02/04/2014 | -100.00 | 900.00
01/04/2014 | 1000.00 | 1000.00
```
